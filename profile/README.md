## Our Events

We organize a variety of events throughout the year, including:

- Workshops: Our workshops cover a wide range of topics, from programming languages to web development to machine learning. They are designed to give students a hands-on learning experience and help them build their coding skills.

- Bootcamps: Our bootcamps are intensive coding programs that give students the opportunity to dive deep into a specific topic or technology. They are designed for students who want to gain expertise in a particular area.

- Guest Lectures: We invite experts from the industry to come and speak to our members. These lectures are a great way to learn about the latest trends and technologies in the field.

- Competitions: We organize coding competitions to help students test their skills and compete with their peers. These competitions are a fun way to learn and grow as a coder.

- Hackathons: Our hackathons are intense coding events where students work in teams to build a project from scratch. They are a great way to learn how to work in a team and build something amazing.

- Presentations: We give presentations to share our experiences, learning, and knowledge with others.
